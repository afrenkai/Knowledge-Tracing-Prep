# GOALS: 

- implement Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)
- Implement robust test cases to ensure that a user (and I) can properly evaluate a model.
- Expand the base Knowledge Tracing (KT) architecture to allow the user to return params, and obtain other diagnostics to ensure the model is functioning properly.
