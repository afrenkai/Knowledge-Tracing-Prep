# GOALS: 

- implement Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) as per https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05908
- implement Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks for Knowledge Tracing as per https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08108
- Implement robust test cases to ensure that a user (and I) can properly evaluate a model.
- Expand the all KT architecture to allow the user to return params, and obtain other diagnostics to ensure the model is functioning properly.
